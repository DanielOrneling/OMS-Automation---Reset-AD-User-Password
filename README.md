# OMS-Automation---Reset-AD-User-Password
Use this Automation Runbook to reset the password of specific AD Users in a really easy way. 
Make sure to delegate rights to the computer object of the Hybrid Worker to the OU in AD, otherwise you will not be granted the access needed. 
See my blog post at (soon to come) for more information and a complete setup guide.
